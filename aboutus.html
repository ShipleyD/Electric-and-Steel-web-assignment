							<h1>A little bit about the parlour...</h1>
							<p>Our brand new custom tattoo studio in Barnstaple has been fitted with all the latest state of the art tattooing equipment and facilities! We also pride ourselves in our impeccable standards of cleanliness and hygiene.</p>
							
							<p>Electric & Steel formed in 2009, starting out as Dave and Pinchy in a small parlour in the centre of Barnstaple. Since then the team has grown, the latest of which was the move to the new store in early 2017 and the merger with local Riverside parlour, the services on offer have expanded as well, now offering gents hair and beard cuts.</p>
							
							<p>Meet our fantastic team of tattoo artists below...</p>

							<h1>A little bit about Dave...</h1>
							<p><blockquote><cite>“I think my style of tattooing could be called “Illustrative Traditional” which seems to suit. In application at least. I use bold lines and black shading which is the basis for all traditional tattooing. I’m inspired more and more by the people themselves rather than the work they produce. I take inspiration from anything that works. Nothing specific. Music, art, film – it’s all one big soup.”</cite></blockquote></p>
							<p>Dave has been tattooing since 2007, working in a few shops in Devon before opening Electric & Steel alongside pinchy in 2009.</p>

							<h1>A little bit about Dan...</h1>
							<p><blockquote><cite>“I’d say my tattoo style is contemporary classic, and I’ve been tattooing almost 4 years now. I started tattooing friends off the back of being a graffiti writer and then was lucky enough to be offered a job at Electric & Steel.”</cite></blockquote></p>
							<p>Dan has been tattooing since 2013 and joined Electric & Steel in 2015.</p>

							<h1>A little bit about Matt...</h1>
							<p><blockquote><cite>“I guess my style is half way between traditional and neo-traditional. I love tattooing in colour or black & grey, I think it lends itself well to either. My designs have a decent amount of black in and good contrast; ageing well with the wearer. I find great personal satisfaction in starting and finishing hand sized, one shot tattoos. This year I’m really going to push myself towards bigger projects, painting more and adapting my style to a yet unknown degree!”</cite></blockquote></p>
							<p>Matt has been tattooing since 2011, working in a few shops in Devon before joining Electric & Steel in 2017.</p>
